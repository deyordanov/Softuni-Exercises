# After a lot of trial and error - creating a MSSQL container with a volume attached to it (without getting issues regarding authorization) can be done by simply running a similar docker-compose.yml file!

# The version of the docker compose file format
version: '3.8'
#Define the services
services:
  mssql:
    # The image from which the container will be created
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    # Set the default user as 'root', otherwise the container will not be able to write in the necessary files
    user: root
    # We expose it on port 1433
    ports:
      - 1433:1433
    environment:
    # Define environment variables
      - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
      - SA_PASSWORD=YourStrongPasswordThatIsLongerThan8Characters!
    # Set the volumes which the container will be mounted to
    volumes:
      - MSSQL_data:/var/opt/mssql/data

# Define the volumes we will be using (they will automatically be created)
volumes:
  MSSQL_data:
