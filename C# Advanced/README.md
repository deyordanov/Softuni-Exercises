The "C# OOP" course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), how to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. You will learn the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. We will delve into commonly used design patterns (creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns). You will become familiar with the SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We will explore different debugging techniques. You will learn how to create and use decorators. We will also focus on component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
