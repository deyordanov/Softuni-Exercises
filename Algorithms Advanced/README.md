# Algorithms Advanced
All the various types of algorithms that are studied in this course will be described below in detail, with examples in C#!

# 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm

How the algorithm works:
   Dijkstra's Algorithm is used, mostly, to find the shortets path in a weighted graph - meaning
   

<Graph indexType="custom" height="400" width="400" nodes={[{label:0,center:{x:113.9,y:165.2}},{label:1,center:{x:330.5,y:282.8}},{label:2,center:{x:141.8,y:372.1}},{label:3,center:{x:302.6,y:75.9}}]} edges={[{label:"5",source:1,target:2},{label:"3",source:1,target:3},{label:"6",source:3,target:0},{label:"4",source:0,target:2}]} />
