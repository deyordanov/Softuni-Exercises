# Algorithms Advanced
All the various types of algorithms that are studied in this course will be described below in detail, with examples in C#!

# 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm

How the algorithm works:
   Dijkstra's Algorithm is used, mostly, to find the shortets path in a weighted graph. In the exaple below the shortest path to node (1) is:
(3) -> (1). Meaning the total cost (sum of all edge weights) is equal to 10. However, if we take the oppsite path, through node 2: (3) -> (2) -> (1), we can clearly see that the cost in this case is equal to 12, which is greater than 10.
